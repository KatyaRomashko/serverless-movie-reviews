### Features

#### Translation Persistence

The application supports translation of reviews into other languages. The structure of a review item includes a `Translations` field to store different language versions of the review text. The application does not include a revalidation of the translated content to save costs.

Example structure for a review item:

+ **MovieId** (Partition key) - Number
+ **ReviewId** - Number (Autogenerated)
+ **ReviewerId** - String (reviewer email address)
+ **ReviewDate** - String, e.g., "2025-01-20" (Updatable)
+ **Content** - String (The review text, updatable)

#### API Gateway Validators

API Gateway validators are used in the endpoints where user input is received to ensure valid data is provided (e.g., validating the email format and ensuring required fields are present).
